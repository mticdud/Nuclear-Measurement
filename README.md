# Nuclear-Measurement
Nuclear Measurements through a Matlab GUI

This repository contains files that define a Matlab Graphical User Interface (GUI) that enables the analysis of various parameters
of the cell nucleus. These parameters for sure include perimeter and area over time. Also included are perimeter and area differences
over time. This means taking the difference from the first frame to current frame. These are presented graphically and also shown in
one set of axes with masks with a colorscheme. Time permitting I will add in curvature analysis capabilities directly in this GUI. For
now, if curvature analysis is desireable I suggest the Cell Curvature respository for individual cases. It does require some knowledge
in Matlab.

Run the GUI by either running the file Nuclear_Measure_GUI or by typing in the same name in the Matlab command line.
